As a quick first blog post, I decided to write about an approach to doing
research that I've had for quite some time now.

In my field, it's quite common for a researcher to mostly publish papers at
conferences. Thus publishing a paper also generally entails creating a
conference talk to provide an overview of the research and ultimately entice the
audience to read the actual paper.

In this post, I want to argue that rather than writing a paper and then preparing the
slides after the paper gets accepted, you should write your slides first. At
first, creating the slides before the paper may seem counterintuitive. After
all, isn't the presentation an opportunity to distill the essence and exciting
pieces of the paper into a talk that encourages the audience to read your paper?
And to do that, don't you need to have the paper written first?

Well, not quite.

The first computer science conference that I ever went to was [PLMW
'12](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/plmw12/) (a workshop co-located with
[POPL](http://www.cse.psu.edu/popl/12/)) as an undergraduate. At PLMW, [Simon
Peyton Jones](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/) gave a great
well-known presentation about [how to write good research
papers](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm)
in which he argued that you should begin writing a research paper first, and
then fill in the gaps with the actual research.

I advocate something similar, but instead of writing the paper, write your
slides first. I suggest doing so for the following reasons:

* In order to write good slides, you have to first figure out how to sell the
  paper and make it exciting to the audience. Once you've figured out what the
  selling points and exciting ideas of the paper are, you can emphasize these
  points in the paper itself, resulting in a stronger submission.
* Creating slides (and practicing the talk) pushes you to think about how to
  explain the idea and what kinds of questions to anticipate. The high-level
  nature of a conference talk is quite different from a paper in which you have
  both the time and the space to explain all of the underlying details.
  Considering an explanation from the high-level ideas and then diving deeper
  into the details provides a nice structure for the paper.
* Slides are highly visual in nature. If you create your slides first, you are
  somewhat forced to think about how to communicate the information visually and
  what supplementary explanation you should include when presenting. This allows
  you to structure your paper around clear visual elements, with accompanying
  information as necessary.
* If you ever find yourself over the page limit for a submission, thinking about
  what you would present and how in a short conference talk can help you decide
  what to cut.

I try to write all of my papers beginning with the slides. I encourage you to
try it out and let me know if it works for you.
