I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
Department](http://ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU)](http://www.cmu.edu/), currently working in the [Network Security
Group](http://netsec.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). My
research interests span several areas of network security, particularly
public-key infrastructures, blockchains and smart contracts, and
decentralization.

In August 2013 I received my M.S. in ECE from CMU. My thesis, titled "A
Scalable and Trustworthy Entity Validation Infrastructure," was supervised by
[Adrian Perrig](http://netsec.ethz.ch/people/aperrig/).

I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Harvey Mudd
College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in 2012, and graduated with high distinction, as
well as departmental honors in computer science. I was advised by [Zach
Dodds](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/) (CS) and [Susan
Martonosi](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~martonosi/) (Math).

During my undergraduate studies, I did research in complex analysis with [Lesley
Ward](http://people.unisa.edu.au/Lesley.Ward) at the [University of South
Australia](http://www.unisa.edu.au/), and in robotics and computer vision with
Zach Dodds.

Besides my studies, I enjoy a number of hobbies, including singing a cappella,
learning languages (mostly High and Swiss German at the moment, though I'm also
dabbling in Croatian), craft beer (with a shameless plug for [Beers 'n'
More](http://www.beersnmore.com/)), traveling, and ballroom dancing (at which I
consider myself modest at best).
